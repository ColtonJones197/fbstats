# Football
I don't like football.

It's hard to play without getting injured. It's hard to watch without having other stuff on in the background because most of the game is downtime.

I'm not saying I don't get into it from time to time. I see why people like it. The people at the top of the game are extremely skilled people and it's fun to watch a 250 pound guy just wreck another 250 pound guy sometimes.

This is my final attempt at liking football by pairing it with a field that I do like: statistics.
I will start by working through the book [Football Analytics With Python and R](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/football-analytics-with/9781492099611/) and go from there. Consider this repo and the writings contained within it to be a review of the book and an overview of its contents.

### Repo Structure
 - [notes](/notes/) will contain my notes, organized by chapter, from the book.
